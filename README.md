## About me

Hey there! I'm a third year PhD student at the Alan Turing Institute using Machine Learning to understand the hyperacute window in trauma.
I'm interested in using computational methods to understand the pathophysiology of immune-driven diseases and to identify possible theraputic targets. 
Lately, I've been involved in developing models for the identification of predictive biomarkers.   

### Work experience

#### Part-time ML engineer at Inflammatix (USA)
I currently work as Machine Learning Engineer on Representation Learning. My work also focuses on the use of generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders to capture meaningful structure in the data. 

#### Intern at Inflammatix (USA)
Interned during summer 2021 at Inflammatix (San Francisco, USA) as ML Engineer. My worked focused on the development of a framework to harmonise different data types together.

#### ML Learning Tutor at Cambridge Spark
I tutor various ML courses at Cambridge Spark including: "Introduction to ML", "Supervised Learning 1 and 2", "Unsupervised Learning", "Ensembles models", "Data visualisation".

### Projects

- Created a [package called EnrichOmics](https://github.com/saramasarone/enrich_omics)to automate workflowes in bioinformatics. The package allows to use the EnrichR and OpenTargets APIs and to get quick results without having to copy paste lists of genes or proteins from and to their website. (2022) 

- Project on Explainable AI: [Communicating high-street bakery sales predictions using counterfactual explanations](https://zenodo.org/record/5562660#.YmLkSS8w2RY) (2021)

- [Tutorial for Apocrita (QMUL's cluster)](https://github.com/saramasarone/Running-kallisto-on-Apocrita) (2020)
