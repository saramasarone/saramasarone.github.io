## About me

Hey there! I'm a third year PhD student at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) and [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). My PhD project focuses on using Machine Learning to understand the immune system of trauma patients in order to provide treatment when it gets dysregulated. More broadly, I'm interested in using data driven methods (both supervised and unsupervised) to disentangle complex biological signals and understand the pathophysiology of immune-driven diseases.
Lately, under the supervision of [Prof Barnes](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/our-team/profiles/barnes-michael.html) and [Prof Pennington](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/blizard/all-staff/profiles/daniel-j-pennington.html), I've also been involved in developing predictive models for the identification of therapeutic targets/predictive biomarkers to provide diagnosis and treatment to patients affected by these conditions. 

## Work experience

**Part-time ML Engineer at [Inflammatix](https://inflammatix.com/ml/) (California,USA):** I currently work as part-time Machine Learning Engineer on Representation Learning. My work focuses on the use of generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders to capture meaningful structure in the data. 

**Intern at Inflammatix (USA):** Interned during summer 2021 at Inflammatix as ML Engineer. My work focused on data harmonisation and the development of a framework for the company.

**ML Learning Tutor at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/?hsLang=en):** Tutored various Machine Learning courses at Cambridge Spark including: "Introduction to Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning 1 and 2", "Unsupervised Learning", "Ensembles" and "Data visualisation".

**ML Summer School at Oxford (2020)** OxML Summer School organised by Sa√Ød Business School (Oxford University), AI for Global Goals, Deep Medicine (Oxford University) and CIFAR. 17th - 25th of August

**Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning Summer School at MILA and CIFAR (2020)**

## Other Projects

- Created a package called [EnrichOmics](https://github.com/saramasarone/enrich_omics) to automate workflowes in bioinformatics. The package allows to use the EnrichR and OpenTargets APIs to get quick results without having to copy-paste lists of genes to their websites. Info can be found on PyPI. Docs can be found [here](https://enrich-omics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)(2022) 


- Project on Explainable AI: [Communicating high-street bakery sales predictions using counterfactual explanations](https://zenodo.org/record/5562660#.YmLkSS8w2RY) (2021)
This challenge aimed to help CatsAi better serve their client (a large wholesaler) to estimate bakery orders to reduce waste and under delivery. The main tasks were to predict high-street sales based on meteorological factors and apply explainability techniques to effectively communicate their outputs to the client. Our research questions we wanted to answer were:

1. Which features are predictive of sales (i.e. orders placed to the warehouse)?
2. Powerful predictive models are often difficult to interpret. Can we explain which features are important to a business owner?

- [Tutorial for Apocrita (QMUL's cluster)](https://github.com/saramasarone/Running-kallisto-on-Apocrita) (2020) Developed a tutorial to help other researchers at QMUL to use array jobs on the cluster and speed up their analyses.
