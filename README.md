## About me

Hey there! I'm a third year PhD student at the Alan Turing Institute and Queen Mary University of London. I use Machine Learning to understand the hyperacute window in trauma and I'm interested in using computational methods to understand the pathophysiology of immune-driven diseases.
Lately, I've been involved in developing models for the identification of therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers.   

### Work experience

#### Part-time ML engineer at [Inflammatix](https://inflammatix.com/ml/) (USA)
I currently work as Machine Learning Engineer on Representation Learning. My work also focuses on the use of generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders to capture meaningful structure in the data. 

#### Intern at Inflammatix (USA)
Interned during summer 2021 at Inflammatix (San Francisco, USA) as ML Engineer. My work focused on data harmonisation and the development of a framework for the company.

#### ML Learning Tutor at Cambridge Spark
Tutored various Machine Learning courses at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/?hsLang=en) including: "Introduction to Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning 1 and 2", "Unsupervised Learning", "Ensembles" and "Data visualisation".

#### ML Summer School at Oxford (2020)
#### Deep Learning Summer School at MILA and CIFAR (2020)
Selected among many applicants (acceptance rate is about 5%)

### Posters and talks
- Poster presentation at [ISMB/ECCB] (https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/posters.php?track=MLCSB&session=D): "Developing a proteomic indicator of injury severity"
- Talk at the Blizard Institute: "Data driven approaches to understand the hyperacute window of trauma patients"
- Poster at William Harvey Research Institute Annual Review - "What similarities are there between trauma, sepsis and covid?"


### Projects

- Created a [package called EnrichOmics](https://github.com/saramasarone/enrich_omics)to automate workflowes in bioinformatics. The package allows to use the EnrichR and OpenTargets APIs to get quick results without having to copy paste lists of genes or proteins from and to their website. Full docs can be found on PyPI. Docs can be found [here] (https://enrich-omics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)(2022) 


- Project on Explainable AI: [Communicating high-street bakery sales predictions using counterfactual explanations](https://zenodo.org/record/5562660#.YmLkSS8w2RY) (2021)

- [Tutorial for Apocrita (QMUL's cluster)](https://github.com/saramasarone/Running-kallisto-on-Apocrita) (2020)
