## About me

Hey there! I'm a third year PhD student at the Alan Turing Institute using Machine Learning to understand the hyperacute window in trauma.
I'm interested in using computational methods to understand the pathophysiology of immune-driven diseases and to identify possible theraputic targets. 
Lately, I've been involved in developing models for the identification of predictive biomarkers.
