## About me

Hey there! I'm a third year PhD student at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk) and [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk). My work entails the use of Machine Learning to understand what goes wrong in the immune system of trauma patients. More broadly, I'm interested in using data driven methods (both supervised and unsupervised) to disentangle complex biological signals and understand the pathophysiology of immune-driven diseases.
Lately, under the supervision of [Prof Barnes](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/c4tb/our-team/profiles/barnes-michael.html) and Prof Pennington (https://www.qmul.ac.uk/blizard/all-staff/profiles/daniel-j-pennington.html), I've also been involved in developing predictive models for the identification of therapeutic targets/predictive biomarkers to provide diagnosis and treatment to patients affected by these conditions. 

## Work experience

#### Part-time ML engineer at [Inflammatix](https://inflammatix.com/ml/) (USA)
I currently work as Machine Learning Engineer on Representation Learning. My work also focuses on the use of generative models such as Variational AutoEncoders to capture meaningful structure in the data. 

#### Intern at Inflammatix (USA)
Interned during summer 2021 at Inflammatix (San Francisco, USA) as ML Engineer. My work focused on data harmonisation and the development of a framework for the company.

#### ML Learning Tutor at Cambridge Spark
Tutored various Machine Learning courses at [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com/?hsLang=en) including: "Introduction to Machine Learning", "Supervised Learning 1 and 2", "Unsupervised Learning", "Ensembles" and "Data visualisation".

#### ML Summer School at Oxford (2020)
#### Deep Learning Summer School at MILA and CIFAR (2020)
Selected among many applicants (acceptance rate is about 5%)

### Posters and talks
- Poster presentation at [ISMB/ECCB] (https://www.iscb.org/cms_addon/conferences/ismbeccb2021/posters.php?track=MLCSB&session=D): "Developing a proteomic indicator of injury severity"
- Talk at the Blizard Institute: "Data driven approaches to understand the hyperacute window of trauma patients"
- Poster at William Harvey Research Institute Annual Review - "What similarities are there between trauma, sepsis and covid?"


### Projects

- Created a [package called EnrichOmics](https://github.com/saramasarone/enrich_omics)to automate workflowes in bioinformatics. The package allows to use the EnrichR and OpenTargets APIs to get quick results without having to copy paste lists of genes or proteins from and to their website. Full docs can be found on PyPI. Docs can be found [here] (https://enrich-omics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)(2022) 


- Project on Explainable AI: [Communicating high-street bakery sales predictions using counterfactual explanations](https://zenodo.org/record/5562660#.YmLkSS8w2RY) (2021)
This challenge aimed to help CatsAi better serve their client (a large wholesaler) to estimate bakery orders to reduce waste and under delivery. The main tasks were to predict high-street sales based on meteorological factors and apply explainability techniques to effectively communicate their outputs to the client. Our research questions we wanted to answer were:

1. Which features are predictive of sales (i.e. orders placed to the warehouse)?
2. Powerful predictive models are often difficult to interpret. Can we explain which features are important to a business owner?
